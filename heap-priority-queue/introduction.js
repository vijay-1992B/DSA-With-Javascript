        HEAP INTRODUCTION
=================================

A Heap is a special type of Binary Tree.

👉 It follows 2 main rules:

1️⃣ Heap is a COMPLETE BINARY TREE
   - All levels are filled
   - Last level fills from LEFT to RIGHT

2️⃣ Heap Property (Two Types)

   🔹 Max Heap:
      Parent node is GREATER than its children
      Example:
            50
           /  \
         30    40

   🔹 Min Heap:
      Parent node is SMALLER than its children
      Example:
            10
           /  \
         20    30

---------------------------------

   Advantages of Heap
- Time complexity to finding the maximum value in Max Heap is O(1)
- Time complexity to finding the minimum value in Min Heap is O(1)
- Time complexity to Inserting element in Heap is O(log n)
- Time complexity to Deleting element in Heap is O(log n)

This file is only for understanding.
We are NOT implementing heap yet.
That will come next step by step.
