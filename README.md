# My DSA Journey with JavaScript 🚀

Hi 👋  
This repository documents my journey of learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **JavaScript**.

I follow a consistent learning system where I strengthen old concepts while learning new ones every day.

---

## 📚 Language Used
- JavaScript (ES6)

---

## 🎯 My Goals
- Improve problem-solving skills  
- Build strong DSA fundamentals  
- Prepare for technical interviews  
- Develop strong logical thinking  

---

## 🧠 My Learning Strategy

Instead of studying one topic and forgetting it later, I follow this system daily:

✅ **1 Problem from an OLD topic** (revision)  
🚀 **1 Problem from a NEW topic** (growth)

This method helps me:
- Retain concepts longer  
- Avoid restarting from zero  
- Stay consistent  
- Build logic step by step
